# GT Big Data Club Installation Guide ![Travis Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gt-big-data/installation-guide.svg?branch=master)

Hi, this is the installation guide for GT Big Data Club. It contains instructions on how to install everything that you need to start hacking with us. Check out the section that your interested in, grab a soda, and start installing!


## Bootstrapping Scripts

This file comes with bootstrapping scripts, if you don't want to read through this documentation.

1. Download the appropriate script as shown below.

**Windows:** Run `scripts/windows.cmd`

**Linux:** Run `scripts/linux.sh`

**Mac:** Run `scripts/mac.sh`

NOTE: The above scripts will download a package manager to your computer to simplify downloading and updating packages in the future.

2. [Install Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)

Then, install the packages required by running this command:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Now, anytime you want to run any Big Data Club stuff, simply run

```
source activate big-data-club
```

and you will have the required packages in that shell!

## General
There are certain tools and technologies that all parts of the team interact with. These are:

#### Package Manager
Package managers make it easier to download programs, handle updates, and set your `PATH` variable. There are different package managers for different OS.

**Windows:** [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org)

**Linux:** [apt-get](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGet/Howto)

**Mac:** [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)

Using a package manager will make the following steps quite trivial, as there will be no need to open up your browser at all!

While others exist, the bootstrapping scripts use the package managers listed above. Feel free to use your favorite package manager!

#### Git:
A free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

You can download Git by going to [this link](http://git-scm.com/download).

If you would like a visual client for Git, GitHub offers a cross- platform app [here](https://desktop.github.com).

#### MongoDB
An extremely popular NoSQL database that organises data as documents of key- value pairs, instead of using tables and rows.

The installer for MongoDB can also be obtained from the MongoDB [website](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community).

Also, optionally install [RoboMongo](http://robomongo.org/), an admin tool for MongoDB.
